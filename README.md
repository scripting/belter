# Belter command line tool

Run this from the command line to communicate directly with the copy of PagePark running on the same machine. It allows you to list processes, stop and restart them, and possibly other things in the future. Patterened after the command line interface of Forever, which is included in PagePark.

For more info on processes see the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/persistentapps.md">docs</a> for persistent apps. 

### How to install the command line tool

1. cd into the cli directory

2. chmod u+x cli.js

3. npm install -g

From there you can type <i>belt</i> at the command line to do stuff with this tool
